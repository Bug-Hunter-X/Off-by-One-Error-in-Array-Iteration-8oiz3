# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The error occurs because the loop condition incorrectly includes the index equal to the array's length, which is an invalid index. 

The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.
